To respect individual privacy concerns, this website does not save your family health history information. However, you can save your family health history to your own local storage area (such as your computer's hard drive, a CD-ROM, or USB thumb drive). In addition, you can save to a third-party system such as Microsoft® HealthVault, Google Drive, and Dropbox (other third party systems will be added in the future). Some hospitals and doctors' offices will be able to obtain this family health history information stored with a third party system, if you grant them permission, and directly incorporate your family health history into an electronic medical record.
