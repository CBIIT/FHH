Those enhancements include a new way to track diseases throughout your entire family. This change cuts down on the amount of data entry, and is a direct result of user feedback submitted through the site (users can still add unique diseases or conditions to each family member individually). Another change is the ability to graphically preview the family tree centered upon a different family member. This preview feature allows someone to carry through all the data previously entered for family members rather than starting over for that new member. In addition to the technical changes, several new family health history projects focus on Alaska Native and Appalachian Communities (http://www.genome.gov/19518941).</p></td>
