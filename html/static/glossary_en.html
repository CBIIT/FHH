<strong>Accidental death</strong>: 
An accidental death happens as the result of an accident such as a car crash, drowning, or fire.</div>

<div class="p">
<strong>Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder/Attention Deficit Disorder</strong>: 
ADHD (Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder) is a problem with inattentiveness, over-activity, impulsivity or a combination of these and other symptoms. To be diagnosed with ADHD, symptoms must be out of the normal range for the child's age and development. Studies show the brains of children with ADHD are different from those of other children. These children handle neurotransmitters (including dopamine, serotonin and adrenalin) differently from their peers. ADHD is, in most cases, genetic. ADHD is also sometimes known as ADD (Attention Deficit Disorder).</div>

<div class="p">
<strong>AIDS</strong>: 
AIDS (Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome) is a chronic, life-threatening condition caused by the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). AIDS is the final and most serious stage of HIV, where there is severe damage to the immune system. By damaging or destroying the cells of a person's immune system, HIV interferes with the body's ability to effectively fight off viruses, bacteria and fungi that cause disease. This makes a person more susceptible to certain types of cancers and to opportunistic infections the body would normally resist. AIDS begins when the CD4 cell (or T-cell) count in an infected person's body is below 200. The most common ways AIDS is transmitted is through sexual contact (including oral, vaginal and anal sex), through blood (via blood transfusions) or needle sharing or from mother to child. A pregnant woman can transmit the virus to her fetus through their shared blood circulation, and a nursing mother can transmit AIDS to her baby in her milk.</div>

<div class="p">
<strong>Alcoholism</strong>: 
Alcoholism refers to any condition that results in the continued consumption of alcoholic beverages despite the health problems and negative social consequences it causes.</div>

<div class="p">
<strong>Alzheimer's disease</strong>: 
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia among older people. Dementia is a brain disorder that seriously affects a person's ability to carry out daily activities.</div>

<div class="p">
<strong>Angina</strong>: 
Angina is chest pain or discomfort as a result of the heart muscle not receiving enough blood or oxygen. Generally, angina may feel like pressure or a squeezing pain in the chest, but the pain may also occur in the shoulders, arms, neck, jaw, or back.</div>

<div class="p">
<strong>Anorexia Nervosa</strong>: 
Anorexia nervosa is an eating disorder characterized by the fear of becoming obese, a distorted self-image, a persistent refusal to eat and severe weight loss. People with anorexia nervosa view themselves as overweight even when they are very thin. Anorexia nervosa often involves frequent vomiting (self-induced), excessive exercise, malnutrition, amenorrhea or other physiological changes. Unusual eating habits may include avoiding food and meals altogether, selecting few foods and eating them in small portions or carefully weighing and portioning food.</div>

<div class="p">
<strong>Anxiety</strong>: 
Fear and anxiety are part of life. You may feel anxious before you take a test or walk down a dark street. This kind of anxiety is useful - it can make you more alert or careful. It usually ends soon after you are out of the situation that caused it. But for millions of people in the United States, the anxiety does not go away, and gets worse over time. They may have chest pains or nightmares. They may even be afraid to leave home.</div>

<div class="p">
<strong>Appendicitis</strong>: 
Appendicitis is inflammation of the appendix, a small pouch located in the lower right abdomen and attached to the large intestine (or colon). Once the inflammation starts, it is considered a medical emergency since there is no effective medical therapy. If treatment is delayed, the appendix can burst, causing infection and even death. Most patients recover without difficulty or with minimal difficulty, when promptly treated. Removal of the appendix (appendectomy) appears to cause no change in digestive function.</div>

<div class="p">
<strong>Arthritis</strong>: 
Arthritis is inflammation of the joints and the breakdown of the cartilage that protects the joints. Cartilage also absorbs shock when pressure is placed on the joint, when walking or when performing other activities that require a person to bear weight. Without the usual amount of cartilage, the bones rub together, causing pain, swelling and stiffness. Common forms of arthritis are gout, osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis.</div>

<div class="p">
<strong>Asthma</strong>: 
Asthma is a disease in which the airways of the lungs are tightened, inflamed or irritated. During normal breathing, air moves freely and airways are relaxed. With asthma, airflow is restricted and the airways are tightened. With less normal air supply, a person can feel short of breath, causing a whistling sound called wheezing. People with asthma usually have red, swollen airways, a condition considered to greatly contribute to long-term damage of the lungs.</div>

<div class="p">
<strong>Autism</strong>: 
Autism is a brain disorder that affects a person's ability to communicate and socially interact. It is also characterized by preoccupation with repetitive activities, excessive attachment to certain objects and short attention span.</div>

<div class="p">
<strong>Bipolar Disorder</strong>: 
Bipolar disorder is a serious mental illness. People who have it experience dramatic mood swings. They may go from overly energetic, "high" and/or irritable, to sad and hopeless, and then back again. They often have normal moods in between. The up feeling is called mania. The down feeling is depression.</div>

<div class="p">
<strong>Bladder Cancer</strong>: 
Bladder cancer is cancer of the organ located in the pelvic cavity that collects and holds urine until it exits your body. Signs or symptoms aren't usually detected in its early stages.</div>

<div class="p">
<strong>Blood clots</strong>: 
A blood clot is blood that has been changed from a liquid to a solid.  When this happens inside of a blood vessel it is also called a thrombus. Blood clots inside blood vessels can remain attached to their place in the blood vessel or they can move from that place through the bloodstream.  Sometimes these clots can block blood flow to important parts of the body such as the heart (heart attack), brain (stroke) or lungs (pulmonary embolism).   There are several conditions that can in run in families that make harmful blood clots more likely to form.</div>

<div class="p">
<strong>Blood Clot in the lungs or arms (Pulmonary Embolism)</strong>: 
A pulmonary embolism is a sudden blockage in a lung artery. The cause is usually a blood clot in the leg called a deep vein thrombosis that breaks loose and travels through the bloodstream to the lung. If a clot is large, or if there are many clots, pulmonary embolism can cause death.</div>

<div class="p">
<strong>Blood Clot in the Legs (Deep Vein Thrombosis)</strong>: 
Deep vein thrombosis, or DVT, is a blood clot that forms in a vein deep in the body. Most deep vein clots occur in the lower leg or thigh. If the vein swells, the condition is called thrombophlebitis. A deep vein thrombosis can break loose and cause a serious problem in the lung, called a pulmonary embolism, or a heart attack or stroke.</div>

<div class="p">
<strong>Bone Disease</strong>: 
Your bones help you move, give you shape and support your body. They are living tissues that rebuild constantly throughout your life. During childhood and your teens, your body adds new bone faster than it removes old bone. After about age 20, you can lose bone faster than you make bone.</div>

<div class="p">
<strong>Breast Cancer</strong>: 
Breast cancer is a malignant (cancerous) tumor that begins in the cells of the breast. The disease occurs mostly in women, but can affect men as well. Breast cancer can spread to other tissues or organs in the body like lymph nodes, bone, liver, lungs and brain.</div>

<div class="p">
<strong>Bulimia</strong>: 
Bulimia is an eating disorder characterized by frequent binge eating followed by measures to prevent weight gain, such as self-induced vomiting, the use of laxatives, dieting or fasting. Bulimia is usually accompanied by feelings of guilt, depression and self-condemnation.</div>

<div class="p">
<strong>Cancer</strong>: 
Cancer begins in your cells, which are the building blocks of your body. Normally, your body forms new cells as you need them, replacing old cells that die. Sometimes this process goes wrong. New cells grow even when you don't need them, and old cells don't die when they should. These extra cells can form a mass called a tumor. Tumors can be benign or malignant. Benign tumors aren't cancer while malignant ones are. Cells from malignant tumors can invade nearby tissues. They can also break away and spread to other parts of the body.</div>

<div class="p">
<strong>Cerebral Palsy</strong>: 
Cerebral palsy is a group of disorders caused by brain damage occurring at or before birth. The disorders are caused by faulty development of, or damage to, motor areas in the brain that disrupts the brain's ability to control movement and posture. Symptoms of cerebral palsy include difficulty with fine motor tasks (such as writing or using scissors), difficulty with walking or maintaining balance, involuntary movements or speech disturbances.</div>

<div class="p">
<strong>Chronic Fatigue Syndrome</strong>: 
Chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) is a syndrome usually accompanied by impairment in short-term memory or concentration, sore throat, tender lymph nodes, muscle or joint pain and headache unrelated to any preexisting medical condition. CFS is characterized as a debilitating and profound syndrome not alleviated by regular bed rest.</div>

<div class="p">
<strong>Chronic Lower Respiratory Disease</strong>: 
Chronic lower respiratory diseases affect the lower part of the respiratory tract including the lungs. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), asthma and chronic bronchitis are examples of chronic lower respiratory disease.</div>

<div class="p">
<strong>Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD)</strong>: 
Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) makes it hard for you to breathe. Coughing up mucus is often the first sign of COPD. Chronic bronchitis and emphysema are common COPDs. Cigarette smoking is the most common cause of COPD. Breathing in other kinds of irritants, like pollution, dust or chemicals, may also cause or contribute to COPD.</div>

<div class="p">
<strong>Cirrhosis</strong>: 
Cirrhosis is a chronic disease of the liver characterized by the replacement of normal tissue with fibrous scar tissue. When scar tissue replaces normal tissue, blood flow through the liver is blocked. Blockage prevents the liver from working properly and can result in the loss of functional liver cells. Though cirrhosis has many causes, alcoholism and hepatitis C are identified as the most common causes.</div>

<div class="p">
<strong>Colon Cancer</strong>: 
Colon cancer or colorectal cancer is a malignant (cancerous) tumor that begins in cells of the colon or rectum. Colon cancer can spread to other tissues or organs in the body like the lymph nodes, liver, lungs and brain.</div>

<div class="p">
<strong>Colonic polyps</strong>: 
A polyp is an extra piece of tissue that grows inside your body. Colonic polyps grow in the large intestine, or colon. Most polyps are not dangerous. However, some polyps may turn into cancer or already be cancer. To be safe, doctors remove polyps and test them.</div>

<div class="p">
<strong>Crohn's disease</strong>: 
Crohn's disease causes inflammation of the digestive system. It is one of a group of diseases called inflammatory bowel disease. The disease can affect any area from the mouth to the anus. It often affects the lower part of the small intestine called the ileum. Crohn's disease seems to run in some families. It can occur in people of all age groups but is most often diagnosed in young adults.</div>

<div class="p">
<strong>Cystic Fibrosis</strong>: 
Cystic fibrosis is a fatal genetic disease that causes the body to produce thick, sticky mucus that clogs the lungs, leads to infection and blocks the pancreas. The blockage stops digestive enzymes from reaching the intestine where they are required in order to digest food.</div>

<div class="p">
<strong>Cystic Kidney Diseases</strong>: 
Cysts are fluid-filled sacs. Sometimes cysts grow in the kidneys. Cysts can keep the kidneys from working well. People with many kidney cysts often have an inherited condition that causes cyst formation.</div>

<div class="p">
<strong>Dementia</strong>: 
Dementia is a word for a group of symptoms caused by disorders that affect the brain. It is not a specific disease. People with dementia may not be able to think well enough to do normal activities, such as getting dressed or eating. They may lose their ability to solve problems or control their emotions. Their personalities may change. They may become agitated or see things that are not there.</div>

<div class="p">
<strong>Depression</strong>: 
Depression is a serious medical illness that involves the brain. It's more than just a feeling of being "down in the dumps" or "blue" for a few days. If you are one of the more than 20 million people in the United States who have depression, the feelings do not go away. They persist and interfere with your everyday life. Depression can run in families, and usually starts between the ages of 15 and 30.</div>

<div class="p">
<strong>Diabetes</strong>: 
Diabetes is a disease in which the body doesn't produce or properly use insulin. Insulin is a hormone produced in the pancreas, an organ near the stomach. Insulin is needed to turn sugar and other food into energy. In a person with untreated diabetes, excessive amounts of sugars build up in the blood.</div>

<div class="p">
<strong>Diabetic kidney disease (Diabetic nephropathy)</strong>: 
If you have diabetes, your blood sugar levels are too high. Over time, this can damage your kidneys. Your kidneys are filters that clean your blood. If they are damaged, waste and fluids build up in your blood instead of leaving your body. Kidney damage from diabetes is called diabetic nephropathy. It begins long before you have symptoms.</div>

<div class="p">
<strong>Digestive Disease</strong>: 
When you eat, your body breaks food down to a form it can use to build and nourish cells and provide energy. This process is called digestion. Your digestive system is a series of hollow organs joined in a long, twisting tube. It runs from your mouth to your anus and includes your esophagus, stomach, and small and large intestines. Your liver, gallbladder and pancreas are also involved. They produce juices to help digestion. Digestive diseases can affect any part of your digestive system.</div>

<div class="p">
<strong>Down Syndrome</strong>: 
Down syndrome is a chromosomal condition most commonly associated with mental retardation and poor muscle tone (hypotonia) during infancy. People with Down syndrome have increased risk for heart defects, digestive problems such as gastroesophageal reflux or celiac disease and hearing loss. In addition, some people with Down syndrome have reduced activity of the thyroid gland (hypothyroidism).</div>

<div class="p">
<strong>Eating disorder</strong>: 
Eating disorders are serious behavior problems. They include:<br />
<ul>
	<li>Anorexia nervosa, in which you become too thin, but you don't eat enough because you think you are fat.</li>
	<li>Bulimia nervosa, involving periods of overeating followed by purging, sometimes through self-induced vomiting or using laxatives</li>
	<li>Binge-eating, which is out-of-control eating</li>
</ul>
</div>

<div class="p">
<strong>Eczema</strong>: 
Eczema is long-lasting chronic disease that affects the skin. It cannot be passed from one person to another. The skin becomes extremely itchy. Repeated and excessive scratching may lead to other symptoms such as redness, swelling, cracking, "weeping" clear fluid and crusting and scaling. Though the cause of eczema is not known, the disease seems to result from a combination of genetic and environmental factors.</div>

<div class="p">
<strong>Emphysema</strong>: 
Emphysema is a lung condition marked by an abnormal increase in the size of the air spaces along with the loss of elasticity of the lung tissue. These characteristics result in heavy breathing and an increased susceptibility to infection.</div>

<div class="p">
<strong>Epilepsy</strong>: 
Epilepsy is a brain disorder that characterized by convulsions, muscle spasms and loss of consciousness. Epilepsy is a disorder with many possible causes. It could result from a brain wiring abnormality, an imbalance of nerve signaling chemicals (neurotransmitters), or a combination of these factors. Epilepsy is not necessarily the same as seizures. Only when people have had two or more seizures are they considered to have epilepsy.</div>

<div class="p">
<strong>Esophageal cancer</strong>: 
The esophagus is a hollow tube that carries food and liquids from your throat to your stomach. Early esophageal cancer usually does not cause symptoms. However, as the cancer grows, symptoms may include painful or difficult swallowing, weight loss and coughing up blood.</div>

<strong>Fibroids</strong>: 
Fibroids are benign tumors of the uterus and the single most common indication for hysterectomy (a surgical operation to remove the uterus). Fibroids can be present yet undetected. They can cause significant morbidity, including prolonged or heavy menstrual bleeding, pelvic pressure or pain, and, in rare cases, reproductive dysfunction. Fibroids may be removed if they cause discomfort or if they are associated with uterine bleeding.</div>

<div class="p">
<strong>Gallbladder Cancer</strong>: 
Gallbladder cancer is a rare disease where malignant (cancerous) cells are found in the tissues of the gallbladder - the pear-shaped organ that lies just under the liver in the upper abdomen. The gallbladder stores bile, a fluid made by the liver to digest fat. When food is being broken down in the stomach and intestines, bile is released from the gallbladder through a tube called the common bile duct, which connects the gallbladder and liver to the first part of the small intestine. Gallbladder cancer may cause jaundice (yellowing of the skin and the whites of the eyes), pain above the stomach, fever, nausea and vomiting, bloating and lumps in the abdomen.</div>

<div class="p">
<strong>Types of Gastrointestinal Diseases</strong>: 
Gastrointestinal diseases, called GI diseases affect the stomach and the body's intestines.</div>

<div class="p">
<strong>Gaucher Disease</strong>: 
Gaucher disease is an inherited metabolic disorder in which harmful quantities of a fatty substance called glucocerebroside accumulate in the spleen, liver, lungs, bone marrow and sometimes in the brain. All Gaucher patients exhibit a deficiency of an enzyme called glucocerebrosidase that is involved in the breakdown and recycling of glucocerebroside. The buildup of this fatty material within cells prevents the cells and organs from functioning properly. Gaucher disease is one of several lipid storage diseases.</div>

<div class="p">
<strong>Gestational diabetes (diabetes and pregnancy)</strong>: 
Diabetes is a disease in which your blood glucose, or sugar, levels are too high. When you are pregnant, too much glucose is not good for your baby. Out of every 100 pregnant women in the United States, between three and eight get gestational diabetes. Gestational diabetes is diabetes that happens for the first time when a woman is pregnant.</div>

<div class="p">
<strong>Glaucoma</strong>: 
Glaucoma is a group of diseases characterized by abnormally high fluid pressure within the eye, damaged optic nerves, hardening of the eyeball and partial to complete loss of vision.</div>

<div class="p">
<strong>Gout</strong>: 
Gout is an inherited disorder where uric acid builds up in the body, often causing painful inflammation of the joints, especially of the feet and hands. Deposits of uric acid can also build up under the skin, forming lumps. Kidney stones may also form from the uric acid buildup.</div>

<div class="p">
<strong>Guillain-Barre Syndrome</strong>: 
Guillain-Barre syndrome (GBS) is an inflammatory/immune disorder of the peripheral nerves-those outside the brain and spinal cord. GBS is characterized by the rapid onset of weakness and, often, paralysis of the legs, arms, breathing muscles and face.</div>

<div class="p">
<strong>Heart Disease</strong>: 
Heart disease is also known as coronary artery disease. It is a chronic condition in which the coronary (heart) arteries become blocked from a build-up of fat-like substances called plaque. The plaque can limit or completely block blood flow to the heart. When this happens, cells in the heart can be permanently injured and die. Heart attacks and angina are usually due to coronary heart disease.</div>

<div class="p">
<strong>High Blood Pressure</strong>: 
See Hypertension.</div>

<div class="p">
<strong>High Cholesterol</strong>: 
Cholesterol is a waxy, fat-like substance that occurs naturally in all parts of the body. Your body needs some cholesterol to work properly. But if you have too much in your blood, it can stick to the walls of your arteries. This is called plaque. Plaque can narrow your arteries or even block them. There are several different types of hyperlipidemia, depending on the type of fat that too high in the blood.</div>

<div class="p">
<strong>HIV</strong>: 
HIV (Human Immunodeficiency Virus) is an infection that gradually destroys the immune system, resulting in infections that are difficult for the body to fight. Though people who become infected with HIV may have no symptoms for up to 10 years, they can still transmit the infection to others. Their immune system gradually weakens until they are diagnosed with AIDS. Common symptoms may include sore throat, muscular stiffness or aching, headache, diarrhea, swollen lymph glands, fever, fatigue, various types of rashes and frequent vaginal yeast infections.</div>

<div class="p">
<strong>Hodgkin's Lymphoma</strong>: 
Hodgkin's lymphoma is a cancer of lymphatic tissue found in the lymph nodes, spleen, liver and bone marrow. The lymph nodes are small, bean-shaped organs found underneath the skin in the neck, underarm and groin, as well as inside the chest, abdomen and pelvis. They make and store white blood cells that fight infection (lymphocytes). They are connected throughout the body by lymph vessels, which carry a colorless, watery fluid (lymphatic fluid) that contains the lymphocytes. For people with Hodgkin's lymphoma, their lymph nodes are swollen causing pressure on the body's important structures.</div>

<div class="p">
<strong>Hypertension</strong>: 
Hypertension is high blood pressure. When it beats, the heart pumps blood to the arteries and creates pressure (blood pressure) in them. This pressure results from blood being pumped into the arteries and through the circulatory system as well as the arteries resisting the blood flow. When healthy, your arteries are muscular and elastic-stretching when blood is pumped through them. Blood pressure is the force in the arteries when the heart beats (systolic pressure) and when the heart is at rest (diastolic pressure) and is measured in millimeters of mercury (mm Hg). Hypertension is defined as a blood pressure greater than or equal to 140 mm Hg systolic pressure or greater than or equal to 90 mm Hg diastolic pressure.</div>

<div class="p">
<strong>Hypochondria</strong>: 
Hypochondria is the persistent conviction that one is or is likely to become ill. This often involves symptoms when illness is neither present nor likely. Hypochondria is persistent despite reassurance and medical evidence to the contrary. People with hypochondria can only temporarily accept assurance that there is no physical explanation to their symptoms.</div>

<div class="p">
<strong>Hypoglycemia</strong>: 
Hypoglycemia, also known as low blood sugar, occurs when your blood glucose (blood sugar) level drops too low to provide enough energy for your body's activities. It is the body's inability to properly handle the large amounts of sugar. Glucose is an important fuel for the body. After meals, carbohydrates are broken down into simple sugars by the digestion process. Sugars enter the bloodstream as glucose, which makes the level of blood sugar rise. The pancreas secretes the hormone insulin into the blood to bring the glucose down to normal levels. For people with hypoglycemia, the pancreas sends out too much insulin and the blood sugar drops below the normal level necessary to maintain well being.</div>

<div class="p">
<strong>Influenza (flu)</strong>: 
Flu is a respiratory infection caused by a number of viruses. The viruses pass through the air and enter your body through your nose or mouth. Between 5% and 20% of people in the U.S. get the flu each year. The flu can be serious or even deadly for elderly people, newborn babies and people with certain chronic illnesses.</div>

<div class="p">
<strong>Insomnia</strong>: 
Insomnia is sleep disorder characterized by an inability to sleep or the inability to remain asleep for a reasonable period during the night. The number of hours of sleep a person gets or how long it takes for a person to fall asleep does not define insomnia. People with insomnia typically are unable to close their eyes for more than a few minutes at a time. Insomnia can be caused by fear, stress and anxiety. An overactive mind can also cause insomnia.</div>

<div class="p">
<strong>Irritable bowel syndrome</strong>: 
Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a problem that affects the large intestine. It can cause abdominal cramping, bloating and a change in bowel habits. Some people with the disorder have constipation. Some have diarrhea. Some go back and forth between constipation and diarrhea. Although IBS can cause a great deal of discomfort, it does not harm the intestines.</div>

<strong>Kidney cancer</strong>: 
You have two kidneys. They are fist-sized organs on either side of your backbone above your waist. The tubes inside filter and clean your blood, taking out waste products and making urine. Kidney cancer forms in the lining of tiny tubes inside your kidneys. It happens most often in people over 40. Risk factors include smoking, having certain genetic conditions and misusing pain medicines for a long time.</div>

<div class="p">
<strong>Kidney Disease</strong>: 
Kidney disease is the result of damage to the tiny structures inside the kidneys that filter blood, known as nephrons. The damage gradually occurs over many years and happens to both kidneys. Some common causes of kidney disease are diabetes, high blood pressure and heredity.</div>

<div class="p">
<strong>Types of Kidney Diseases</strong>: 
Kidney diseases are diseases that interfere with the kidney's ability to filter waste products and clean the blood.</div>

<div class="p">
<strong>Kidney diseases present from birth</strong>: 
These are kidney diseases that a baby is born with. An example is a rare type of kidney disease where the baby has many kidney cysts (fluid filled sacs) at birth. It is called autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease (sometimes called ARPKD). ARPKD can be passed on in families.</div>

<div class="p">
<strong>Leukemia</strong>: 
Leukemia is cancer of the white blood cells. White blood cells help your body fight infection. Your blood cells form in your bone marrow. In leukemia, however, the bone marrow produces abnormal white blood cells. These cells crowd out the healthy blood cells, making it hard for blood to do its work.</div>

<div class="p">
<strong>Lung Cancer</strong>: 
Lung cancer is uncontrolled growth of abnormal cells in one or both of the lungs. Normal lung tissue cells reproduce and develop into healthy lung tissue. However, abnormal cells reproduce rapidly and never grow into normal lung tissue, resulting in tumors. The tumors disrupt the lung, making it difficult to function properly.</div>

<div class="p">
<strong>Lung Disease</strong>: 
When you breathe, your lungs take in oxygen from the air and deliver it to the bloodstream. The cells in your body need oxygen to work and grow. People with lung disease have difficulty breathing. The term lung disease refers to many disorders affecting the lungs, such as asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, infections like influenza, pneumonia and tuberculosis, lung cancer, and many other breathing problems.</div>

<div class="p">
<strong>Types of Lung Diseases</strong>: 
Lung diseases are diseases that affect the body organs used for breathing.</div>

<div class="p">
<strong>Lymphoma</strong>: 
Lymphoma is a cancer of a part of the immune system called the lymphatic system. There are many types of lymphoma. One type is called Hodgkin's disease. The rest are called non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.</div>

<strong>Marfan Syndrome</strong>: 
Marfan syndrome is a hereditary condition that affects the tissue that holds the body together and provides a framework for growth and development (connective tissue). In Marfan syndrome, the connective tissue is defective and does not act as it should. Since connective tissue is found throughout the body, Marfan syndrome can affect many of the body's systems, including the skeletal system, circulatory system, nervous system, eyes, skin and lungs.</div>

<div class="p">
<strong>Multiple Sclerosis</strong>: 
Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an unpredictable disease of the central nervous system in which communication between the brain and other parts of the body is disrupted. Many experts believe MS is an autoimmune disease, where the immune system launches a defensive attack against its own tissues. The initial symptom of MS is often blurred or double vision, red-green color distortion, or even blindness in one eye. Most MS patients experience muscle weakness in their extremities and have difficulty with coordination and balance. There are instances where people with MS may suffer from hearing loss.</div>

<div class="p">

Muscular dystrophy (MD) is a group of rare inherited diseases where muscle fibers are unusually susceptible to damage. MD is characterized by progressive weakness and degeneration of the skeletal muscles that control movement. In the latter stages of muscular dystrophy, fat and connective tissue often replace muscle fibers. In some types of muscular dystrophy, heart muscles, other involuntary muscles and other organs are affected. People with MD may experience symptoms like muscle weakness, lack of coordination, loss of mobility and progressive crippling.</div>

<ul>
	<li>Joints losing their normal shape.</li>
	<li>Bone spurs growing on the edges of the joint.</li>
	<li>Bits of bone or cartilage breaking off and floating inside the joint space, which causes more pain and damage.</li>
</ul>
</div>

Prostate cancer is a malignant tumor that begins in the prostate gland of men. The prostate gland produces seminal fluid, the liquid in semen that protects, supports and helps transport sperm. Cancer in the prostate develops when changes occur in DNA for all types of cells. Normal cells may grow unregulated by the processes that normally control cell birth and death, when DNA is changed. Men with prostate cancer may experience frequent urination, pain or burning during urination, weak or interrupted urine flow, and the urge to urinate frequently at night.</div>

<div class="p">
<strong>Psoriasis</strong>: 
Psoriasis is a chronic skin disease of scaling and inflammation occurring when skin cells rise quickly from their origin below the surface of the skin and pile up on the surface before they have a chance to mature (turnover). Turnover usually takes about a month, but in psoriasis it may occur in only a few days. It typically results in patches of thick, red (inflamed) skin covered with silvery scales. They most often occur on the elbows, knees, legs, scalp, lower back, face, palms and the soles of the feet, but they can occur on skin anywhere on the body.</div>

<strong>Seizures</strong>: 
Seizures are temporary changes in the brain's function, in the form of a changed mental state, tonic or clonic movements of the arms and legs, and various other symptoms. Seizures can cause involuntary changes in body movement or function, sensation, awareness or behavior. A seizure can last from a few seconds to a continuous state that does not stop without intervention. Seizures are often associated with a sudden and involuntary contraction of a group of muscles. However, a seizure can also be as subtle as marching numbness of a part of body, a brief loss of memory, sparkling flashes, smelling or sensing an unpleasant odor, a strange epigastric sensation or a sensation of fear. Therefore seizures are typically classified as motor, sensory, autonomic, emotional or cognitive.</div>

<div class="p">
