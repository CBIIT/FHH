This product is very simple to install.  Simple clone/fork this project and recurively copy the FHH directory into your htdocs directory of your web server.  If you want, you can recursively copy the FHH-admin directory to be in the same directory as the FHH in order to expose the admin functions (php must be activated for the admin functions).

To access the site.  Goto:

http://[your web address]/FHH

or 

http://[your web address]/FHH-admin/admin.php
